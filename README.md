# 🌿 Plant Diseases Detection  
> Embedded AI system for early plant disease detection using Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32, and ResNet-50.

---

## 🧩 Overview  
This project aims to design and implement an **embedded intelligent system** capable of detecting plant diseases using **computer vision** and **environmental sensors**.  
The solution combines:
- A **ResNet-50** deep learning model deployed on a **Raspberry Pi 4**.  
- A set of sensors (BMP280, humidity, and light sensors) connected to an **ESP32**.  
- An **OLED screen** that displays both predictions and environmental data in real time.  

The system assists farmers and agronomists in early disease detection — even **without Internet access** — providing a low-cost, portable, and autonomous tool for sustainable agriculture.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **Real-time image analysis** of plant leaves using ResNet-50.  
- **Acquisition of environmental data** (temperature, soil moisture, light intensity).  
- **On-device disease prediction** and OLED display output.  
- **Hardware integration** for portability, autonomy, and low power consumption.  

---

## 🧠 Methodology  
Two complementary development models were adopted:
- **CRISP-DM** for building and validating the machine learning model.  
- **V-Model** for the embedded hardware–software development cycle.

## ⚙️ System Architecture  

### Physical Architecture  
- **Tier 1 — Presentation:** OLED display (output interface).  
- **Tier 2 — Control:** ESP32 microcontroller (sensor data collection + UART transmission).  
- **Tier 3 — Processing:** Raspberry Pi 4 (AI inference + data aggregation + visualization).  

### Logical Architecture  
Implemented using an **MVC pattern** and design patterns (**Singleton**, **Observer**) to improve modularity and maintainability.
